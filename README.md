### This project uses the **ESPN Fantasy Sports API v3**

### FFL Trade Tips V1 allows the user to create an account, add their ESPN Fantasy Football Public leagues to their account, generate trade suggestions, and simulate trades

### I chose these features because simulating and generating trades is not something ESPN offers, but would be very useful. The scope of this projects is purposefully small-scale in v1 as its primary purpose it to showcase what I've learned thus far in Springboard's Software Engineering Bootcamp.
